💻 Simple Calculator – HTML, CSS, JavaScript
This is a basic yet fully functional calculator web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs standard arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The main idea behind this project was to create a clean and easy-to-use calculator interface, similar to what you’d find on any smartphone or desktop. I started by structuring the layout with HTML, styling it with CSS for a modern and minimal look, and then brought it to life using JavaScript to handle all the functionality.

✨ Features
Real-time input and display updates

Clear (C) and backspace (←) functionality

Responsive layout for different screen sizes

Accurate expression evaluation using eval()

Visual feedback on button interactions

🎯 Purpose
This project helped me strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and writing clean, modular JavaScript code. It also gave me hands-on experience in designing simple, user-friendly interfaces that work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

🚀 Deployment
I deployed this calculator using Vercel, which makes it easy to host and share live web projects.
